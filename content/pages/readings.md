There is not one textbook. The material will be inspired from various sources. Here is a list of references that sometimes go way beyond what we'll do in class.

For Acoustics, see the book:  
Kinsler, Lawrence E. _Fundamentals of Acoustics_. Wiley, 1999. ISBN: 9780471847892.

For Continuum Mechanics, a decent book is:  
Spencer, A. J. M. _Continuum Mechanics_. Dover Publications, 2004. ISBN: 9780486435947. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=AJdfQL0rgrgC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

For Optics, the best book is:  
Born, Max, and Emil Wolf. _Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light_. Cambridge University Press, 1999. ISBN: 9780521642224. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=kURdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

For Radar Imaging, see the review article "[A Mathematical Tutorial on Synthetic Aperture Radar](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0036144500368859)" by Margaret Cheney as well as her book:  
Cheney, Margaret, and Brett Borden. _Fundamentals of Radar Imaging_. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2009. ISBN: 9780898716771. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=E7M7HQGB0EwC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

For Computerized Tomography, see the book:  
Natterer, F., and Frank WuÌˆbbeling. _Mathematical Methods in Image Reconstruction_. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2001. ISBN: 9780898714722. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=A0Z7Te0k7YsC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

For Seismology, see the review notes "[Mathematics of Reflection Seismology (1995)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.53.5197)" by William W. Symes.

For the introductory treatment of Wave Equations, I've used:  
Evans, Lawrence C. _Partial Differential Equations_. American Mathematical Society, 2010. ISBN: 9780821849743. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=Xnu0o_EJrCQC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

Folland, Gerald B. _Introduction to Partial Differential Equations_. Princeton University Press, 1975. ISBN: 9788120318854.

John, Fritz. _Partial Differential Equations_. Springer, 2013. ISBN: 9781468493351.

Whitham, Gerald Beresford. _Linear and Nonlinear Waves_. Wiley-Interscience, 1999. ISBN: 9780471359425.

["Notes on the Algebraic Structure of Wave Equations" (PDF)](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/18.369/wave-equations.pdf) by Steven Johnson.

For Geometrical Optics, I like "[Lectures on Geometrical Optics](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~rauch/courses.html)" by Professor Jeffrey Rauch.

We gave a [Summer School on Waves and Imaging](http://www.g2s3.org/) in 2011 in Vancouver, Canada. Some of the material listed there will be useful as well.
